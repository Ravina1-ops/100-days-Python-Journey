# Variables and Data Types 
''' variable are containers which holds data and data type is type of data stored '''
a = 5 #initialize a variable a which store a value
print(a,type(a)) #integer data type
b = complex(8,3)
print(b, type(b)) 
c = True
print(c , (type(c))) #type(c) tell the data type it is in built function of python 
d = "Ravina"
print(d,(type(d)))

# Data types in python = int boolean string list tuple and dict 
# everthing in python is object 
g = 87
print(a + g ,(type(g)))
h= " Saini"
print(d + h)

# Operation will perform on same data type
